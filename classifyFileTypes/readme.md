# What this script does?

This script moves all the files of a type (example: .mp3 or pdf) from directory and it's subdirectories to an output folder.

### When the idea come from

Why I created this script? Well, today I was cleaning my computer (because I've just buy a new one so I wanted to organised the old one). The "downloads folder" for the old computer had like 3.000 files (pdf, jpg...) So It was like, OMG moving this is a shit!!! And I don't like the idea to search the types files and then move it manually. So I decided to create this script ;-).

### How to use

- Accepted arguments: By now, you can pass the following arguments: pdf, jpg, zip, dmg...

Example: Moves all the .pdf files to a folder called "pdf".
		./classify.sh pdf 
Example2: Moves all the .jpg files to a folder called "jpg".
		./classify.sh mp3

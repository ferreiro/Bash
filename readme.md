# What it's all about?

Hello! In this repo I'll upload some bash scripts that I'm going to make to automate some tasks I do on my day to day.

## How to run?

1. Download the .sh code.
2. In your terminal type: ./filename.sh and that's it.

NOTE: .sh file has to be an executable file. So in order to make it works, type: chmod +x filename.sh. and then just run as the (2) point on your terminal.

### Disclaimer.

I'm not a bash expert and I'm learning every day. So if you have some suggestions to improve my code or to make a bug fixes, would be awesome to read your issue or pull request. ;-)

Some of the scripts are a work in progress work. Others are just experimental stuff. Please, don't use if you are not sure (or don't use if some of your data may be compromise). 

When the code is well tested and stable, I'll notify you via the readme for each folder ;-).

Thanks!
Jorge.

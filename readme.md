# What it's all about?

Hello! In this repo I'll upload bash scripts that I'm making to automate tasks In my day to day.

## How to run?

1. Download the .sh code.
2. In your terminal type: ./filename.sh and that's it. (Some bash code accepts arguments, So please read the readme for each project)

NOTE: .sh file has to be an executable file. So in order to make it works, type: chmod +x filename.sh. and then just run as the (2) point on your terminal.

### Disclaimer.

I'm not a bash expert and I'm learning every day. So if you have some suggestions to improve my code or to fix a bug. Feel free to open an issue or make a pull request. Thank you! ;-)

Note: Some of the scripts are a work in progress. Others are just experimental stuff. Please, don't use them if you are not sure (or don't use if some of your crucial data may be compromised).

  When the code is well tested and stable, I'll notify you via the readme for each folder ;-).

Thanks!
Jorge.
